# kernel installer


Inspired by AnyKernel, this tool allows Xperia kernels to be flashed to any ROM, regardless of the ramdisk used. This dramatically increases compatibility while decreasing size.

But, unlike AnyKernel, this kernel installer allows for the SELinux setting to be set at **the time of install**, based on the user's choice. For kernel developers this means only one zip has to be uploaded, instead of both a permissive and an enforcing variant.

At this time, the tool is still fairly new and unpolished. Code is dirty, and compatibility with devices is severely limited, so pull requests and tips of any kind are appreciated.
